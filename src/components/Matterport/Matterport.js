              Using Matterport's LiDAR 3D cameras, we were able to capture the sociality of dorm rooms and  <br />showcase them to prospective students and parents. Matterport is a leading provider <br /> of 3D scanning technology that enabled us to create immersive and interactive experiences of  <br />physical spaces. With Matterport's technology, we were able to provide potential residents <br /> with a more realistic and comprehensive representation of the dorm rooms, which can help <br /> them make more informed decisions before moving in.
